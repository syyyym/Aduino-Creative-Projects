# Movement Sensitive Hourglass


## Creative Effect

Just like an hourglass, the leds light up gradually, simulating the passing of time. 
When the total time has finished, there is also a sound. The timer can be reset by movement 
- turning it over. The time interval can be changed, from seconds, minutes, to hours.

## Description

The leds light one by one, after a set interval of time, until the last led has been lit. 
The tilt switch works like an on/off sensor, detecting orientation, and resets the leds and 
the timer when moved.
